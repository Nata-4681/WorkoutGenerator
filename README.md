# Workout Generator

<hr />
<h4>What is it?</h4>
<hr />
Due to frequent boredom in the mind of a Java developer, and the immeasurable amount of time seemingly spent on a treadmill in the morning, I have created this.

This -- being a workout generator based on your current skill level as a lifter. Lifters who are more experienced may choose a more complex workout, and vice versa.

<h4>How to Use?</h4>
<hr />
Simply open the built jar file, and follow the instructions printed on the screen!

Note: Working out is not for everyone. If you feel as though you cannot handle a workout generated by this program, feel free to decrease reps or sets for your own personal safety. If you get hurt it is not my fault!

<h4>Stats (For all you other coding nerds)</h4>
<hr />
Workouts are generated through a custom "Workout" object, which takes in Strings as the main part of the workout, and varargs for the second half of the workout, or circuit.

The workouts are already pre-made, so generation is instant.

I used a custom swing program generator for the design of the GUI, download that at the Eclipse marketplace by searching for *WindowBuilder*
